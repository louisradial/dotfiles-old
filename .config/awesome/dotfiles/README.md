# Dotfiles-AwesomeWM

## Notice
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The use of the progress bars for volume and brightness is done by external scripts in bash.
You can find them in my repo under Scripts-AwesomeWM

### Do mind that some things have to be tweaked for your system,

For ex:
I have an AMD Cpu, internal AMD Gpu and an NVIDIA RTX Gpu,
I control my brightness with /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl1 or amdgpu_bl0.
Yours might be different, same goes for storage etc but you get the point.

### Enjoy
